Introduction: 
In this project, we are going to make an NGO management system. This will work on the basic 
needs of humans like health, food, shelter, education, clothes. This will help the NGO authority to operate 
their work and the consumer gets an easy way to get help from the organization. And also using this app 
any donor can donate directly to the NGO.
Motivation: 
Every day we see a lot of poor people searching for their basic needs. May be they could manage 
it but they had to do a lot of trouble. Realizing it, we decided to make this type of project to help poor 
people with this Organization. By using this app, we can manage all the department of the organization.
